The pois2 package contains functions for the bivariate Poisson distribution. This is currently very much a work in progress. It might not even work properly. Currently, three functions are available: dpois2, rpois2, and lambda3.ml.

Installation
============

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("opisthokonta/pois2")
```
