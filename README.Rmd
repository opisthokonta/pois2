The pois2 package contains functions for the bivariate Poisson distribution. This is currently very much a work in progress, I would consider it being at the alpha development stage. It might not even work properly. Currently, only two functions, dpois2 and rpois2 are available. 

# Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("opisthokonta/pois2")
```
